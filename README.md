Summary:

Assignment 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Objective: Familiarize yourself with the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps.
Tasks:
Load the provided dialogue dataset.
Analyze the data to understand its structure and content.
Implement preprocessing steps such as tokenization, normalization, and handling missing values.
Prepare the data for subsequent modeling tasks.

Assignment 2: Implementing a Neural Network for Intent Recognition
Objective: Develop a neural network model to classify user intents based on their utterances.
Tasks:
Design a neural network architecture suitable for intent classification.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Assignment 3: Dialogue State Tracking
Objective: Create a module to keep track of the dialogue state throughout a conversation.
Tasks:
Define a representation for the dialogue state that captures necessary context.
Implement a mechanism to update the dialogue state based on user and system interactions.
Integrate the dialogue state tracker with the intent recognition model from Assignment 2.
Test the system to ensure accurate state tracking across various dialogue scenarios.

Assignment 4: Response Generation
Objective: Develop a natural language generation (NLG) component to produce appropriate system responses.
Tasks:
Design an NLG module that generates coherent and contextually relevant responses.
Utilize the dialogue state information to inform response generation.
Implement techniques to ensure variability and naturalness in the responses.
Evaluate the generated responses for fluency, relevance, and coherence.
