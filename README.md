Summary:

Assignment 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
<br>Objective: Familiarize yourself with the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps.
<br>Tasks:
<br>Load the provided dialogue dataset.
<br>Analyze the data to understand its structure and content.
<br>Implement preprocessing steps such as tokenization, normalization, and handling missing values.
<br>Prepare the data for subsequent modeling tasks.

Assignment 2: Implementing a Neural Network for Intent Recognition
<br>Objective: Develop a neural network model to classify user intents based on their utterances.
<br>Tasks:
<br>Design a neural network architecture suitable for intent classification.
<br>Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
<br>Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Assignment 3: Dialogue State Tracking
<br>Objective: Create a module to keep track of the dialogue state throughout a conversation.
<br>Tasks:
<br>Define a representation for the dialogue state that captures necessary context.
<br>Implement a mechanism to update the dialogue state based on user and system interactions.
<br>Integrate the dialogue state tracker with the intent recognition model from Assignment 2.
<br>Test the system to ensure accurate state tracking across various dialogue scenarios.

Assignment 4: Response Generation
<br>Objective: Develop a natural language generation (NLG) component to produce appropriate system responses.
<br>Tasks:
<br>Design an NLG module that generates coherent and contextually relevant responses.
<br>Utilize the dialogue state information to inform response generation.
<br>Implement techniques to ensure variability and naturalness in the responses.
<br>Evaluate the generated responses for fluency, relevance, and coherence.
